    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>I've worked on a lot of stuff for LLS and it's various facets. I've created mark-up and styles based on designs
        for Light the Night, Team in Training, the Luekemia Cup Regatta, and LLS of Canada's home page. I've updated the
        content on some thier man of the year site as well.</p>

    <p>Yet, when this was posted, only a handful of that work has gone live.</p>

    <p>Typically, the work I generated was to be handed off to a team of remote Drupal devs in India. As such, a lot of
        the work that <i>has</i> gone live is drastically different than the work I actually did.</p>

    <p>As such, most of the following links are to my orginial work hosted by Freckle Interactive.</p>

    <p>
        All of the following are <span>responsive</span>, <span>cross-browser compliant</span>, and
        <span>pixel perfect</span>
        -- unless otherwise noted.
