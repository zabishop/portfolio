    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>For the last 15 months or so I've been working for Freckle Interactive, LLC.</p>
    <p>The bulk of my client work has been front-end stuff.  <span>HTML5</span>, <span>CSS3</span>, <span>JavaScript</span>, <span>PHP</span>, and the like.</p>
    <p>I'm a whiz at <span>cross-browser testing</span>, <span>responsive layouts</span>, and <span>cutting-up designs into semantic code</span> with <span>pixel-perfect accuracy</span>.</p>
    <p>I've also done my fair share of projects involving <span>C#</span>, <span>Xarmin</span>, and other mobile development related thingies.</p>
    <p>I believe in <span>table-less design</span>, <span>never using ids for styling</span>, <span>mobile-first development</span> and <span>test-driven programming</span>.</p>
    <p>I'm the capricious creator and destroyer of <span>bugs</span> (i.e. I have excellent trouble-shooting skills).</p>
    <p>I'm a fan of all sorts of IDEs.  I'm very partial to <span>JetBrain's products</span>. Although, I have a soft spot in my heart for <span>Sublime Text</span>.</p>
    <p>I shouldn't have to say this, but all my code is <span>hand-coded</span>.  <span>WYSIWYG editors are the spawn of Satan</span>.  I'm looking at you, <span>Dreamweaver</span>.</p>
    <p>I enjoy <span>disc golf</span>, <span>vintage bikes</span>, <span>geocaching</span>, <span>all things Star Trek</span>, <span>Victorian Domesticity</span>, and the occasional <span>penguin</span>.</p>
